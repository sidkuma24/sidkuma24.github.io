I am a 2nd Semester Computer Science Masters Student at San Jose State University. I have spent most of my time here learning and applying deep learning in my projects. I am interested in building machine learning models for solving problems in computer vision and natural language processing. 
I currently working on using very deep residual networks for image classification and object recongition.<br><br>
