I am a Computer Science masters student, currently working as a Full-stack developer using AngularJS, Java, Springboot, NodeJS and MongoDB. I work mostly on adding new services and features to the platform along with enhancements and optimizations on some of the existing features, to make them more powerful and easy to use. 
As a part of my graduate thesis, I am currently working on real-time object recognition using deep neural networks. Where I am working on the current state-of-the-art to find ways to improve detection time high-resolution images and videos.
In the past, I have worked on projects related to Sentiment analysis and speech synthesis using deep neural networks.
