## Introduction

In this post we will talk about the object detection system using Faster R-CNN propsoed by _Ren et. al._ in 2015. Faster R-CNNs are made up of two modules. The first one is a fully convolutional network called the Region Proposal Network (**RPN**) and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector that uses the proposed regions for classification. The entire system is one single combined system for object detection. The RPN module tell the R-CNN where to look. The following figure shows the Faster R-CNN.

## Region Proposal Networks

An RPN takes as input an image and returns a set of rectangules, these are the object proposals and each of them has a objectness score. This is done using a fully convolutional network, which shares some layers with a Fast R-CNN object detection network. The regions are generated by using a small network over the convolutional feature map. This feature map is the output of the last shared convolutional layer. The small network takes as input a _n x n_ region of the feature map, which is then mapped to a lower-dimension feature with 256 layers (filters), _256-d_. These are input into two parallel full connected layer, a box-regression layer (_reg_) and a box-classification layer (_cls_). _Ren et.al_ [1]
